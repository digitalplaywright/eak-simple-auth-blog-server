# Rails Token Auth

There is a Rails server using Devise/Doorkeeper for token auth. It is a minimalist example meant as
companion to the [EAK-Simple-Auth](https://github.com/kagemusha/eak-simple-auth) , an example of a
token auth client based on [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit)
and [Ember-Simple-Auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth)
