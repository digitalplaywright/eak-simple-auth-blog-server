# Rails Token Auth

A minimalist example Rails server using Devise/Doorkeeper for token auth. It's meant as a
companion to the [EAK-Simple-Auth](https://github.com/kagemusha/eak-simple-auth) , an example of a
token auth client based on [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit)
and [Ember-Simple-Auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth)

## Getting Started

Install gems and create a database

```
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

Run the server:

```
rails s
```
